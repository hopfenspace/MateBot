# MateBot core v0.6 (2022-12-24)

- **New feature** of a fully usable CLI to manage users and applications, which
  also solved the "first user problem" by being able to promote them manually
- **New feature** of the "auto mode", which can be used to bootstrap the MateBot
  core API in just a single command (mainly configured by environment variables)
- **Breaking change** by switching from SHA512-hashed passwords with multiple
  iterations to Argon2, which also fixed a GitHub security notice; however,
  this breaks the current login workflow for existing applications -- therefore,
  all applications must be re-created after this release has been applied (#122)
- **Notable change** by replacing the `GET /status` endpoint with the
  unauthenticated `GET /health` endpoint (#102)
- Added support for Docker (#119)
- Allow overwriting almost all config settings environment variables
- Extended the unittest suite to perform load tests and CLI tests as well
- Fixed three failing unittests (#118)

Merry Christmas :)

# MateBot core v0.3 (2022-02-01)

Re-implementation as [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)-based
HTTP microservice as a full REST API. This release included the use of
SQLAlchemy as database ORM, authentication using JWT and versioned
endpoints starting with `/v1`. The API as well as the database models
are also checked using Python unittests that are run using GitHub CI.

First implementation as a rudimentary Telegram bot that provides the core
commands (`balance`, `send`, `pay`, `communism`, `history`, `zwegat` and
