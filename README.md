# MateBot

Telegram Bot that sells Mate, ice cream and pizza and allows you to share bills

## Installation

### Requirements

- Python 3.7.3 (That's what our server run and we like features)
- [python-telegram-bot](https://pypi.org/project/python-telegram-bot/)
- [tzlocal](https://pypi.org/project/tzlocal/)
- [pymysql](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/)

You may have [mysqlclient](https://pypi.org/project/mysqlclient/) installed
on your machine. In case it's available, we prefer it over
[pymysql](https://pypi.org/project/PyMySQL/). However, it requires installation
of OS-specific libraries which the pure-Python implementation does not.
Therefore, there's the requirement for the pure-Python library while
the other one could be used too.
