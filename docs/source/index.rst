The API provided in this package allows clients to handle a diverse user base,
where every user has any number of associated aliases but one shared balance.
It can be sent to other users, shared in bills or refunded by the community
by a community poll, where every user has the equal privileges and voting
weight. Additionally, the API provides endpoints to easily consume any
amount of consumables and vouch for other users in case of high debts.
